   - Make sure to use the same Microsoft account that is linked to your device where BitLocker is enabled.

   - Click on the **device name** to view its details.

#### 6. **Click on "Show Recovery Key" Under Operating System Drive**
   - In the **BitLocker keys** section, you will see multiple recovery keys listed for your device. Find the entry under the **Operating System Drive** (usually labeled with the drive letter, typically **C:**, where Windows is installed).
   - Click on **Show recovery key**. This will reveal the **48-digit BitLocker recovery key** needed to unlock your system.

#### 7. **Enter or Copy the Recovery Key**
   - Once the recovery key is revealed, you have two options:
     1. **Type the Recovery Key**: Carefully type the **48-digit recovery key** manually into the prompt on your locked system. Ensure there are no errors when typing, as even a single mistake can prevent the system from unlocking.
     2. **Copy and Paste the Recovery Key**: Alternatively, you can **copy the key** from the Microsoft account page and then **paste it** directly into the BitLocker prompt on your device. This is often easier and reduces the risk of typos.
   - After entering the correct recovery key, your system will authenticate the key and unlock the **BitLocker-encrypted drive**. Your device will then grant you access to the operating system and all of your files.

Once successfully entered, the **BitLocker encryption** will be disabled temporarily, allowing you to boot into Windows and access your data. If needed, you can re-enable BitLocker encryption after the system is fully accessible and working. Make sure to store the recovery key in a secure location for future reference, as it is critical for accessing encrypted data should any future issues arise.
